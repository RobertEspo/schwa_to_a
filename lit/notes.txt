l1 spanish: minimal centralization of unstressed syllables, not perceivable. low-level phonetic phenomenon.
willis2005initial, lipski1994tracing: there may be dialectal differences, but no variety unequivocably displays morphophonological reduction like English.

English allophonic unstressed vowel reduction, morphophonological:

morphophonological vs low-level phonetic differences (Bybee 2001)




need to figure out how to calculate eud, can you do it when you just have one vowel?

plot:
gam_3_preds_2 |>
plot(series = "timep", comparison = "session") +
facet_grid(cols = vars(vowel)) # maybe modify this to do individual participants? would need to modify predict_gams to include random effects?

plan: model f1 & f2 separately. predict with predict_gams. combine the resulting dfs and plot with gganimate.

METHODS:
10 participants shadowed 126 words that they believed to be Spanish. 
They repeated each word 3 times, for a total of 378 words per participant.
3780 words in total.
All words were bisyllabic paroxytones. The final vowel was always unstressed /a/.
Force alignment with Montreal Forced Aligner. Corrections have started.
FastTrack used. Set to 3 formants (so it prioritizes the first 3 formants). Extracts values every 2 ms.
Vowels were of different durations, so:
1. time was normalized
2. normalized times were binned into 11 bins
3. f1 and f2 averaged for each bin
4. plotted to f1xf2 space to see trajectory
