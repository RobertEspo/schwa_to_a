praatScripts
============

# Basic info

- This folder contains the praat scripts used to clean the original 
audio files and extract data for the two production tasks
- Copies of most of these scripts are also found in the individual 
data folders

# Data structure

- The production data has the following structure

prodShadow -> data -> all      -> prodShadow.csv
					  session0 -> participantName -> participantName_prodShadow_date.csv
					  session1						 participantName_prodShadow_date.psydat
					  etc.							 participantName_prodShadow0_date.MP3
													 participantName_prodShadow0_date.TextGrid
													 label_from_text_file.praat
													 labels.txt
													 save_labeled_intervals_to_wav_sound_files.praat
													 wavs 											-> .wav files
																									   .textgrid files





# Process

1. '0_label_from_text_file.praat'
	- The 'label_from_text_file.praat' file takes a word list (labels.txt) 
and fills in the already segmented textgrid.
	- Must make 'labels.txt' file first
	- It is still necessary to double check alignment and accuracy
2. '1_save_labeled_intervals_to_wav_sound_files.praat'
	- The 'save_labeled_intervals_to_wav_sound_files.praat' file uses the 
	segmented textgrid from (1) and creates individual sound files
	- The sound files are saved in a 'wav' folder
	- These are the files to be analyzed
3. '2_normalizeScalePeakIntensity.praat'
	- The 'normalizeScalePeakIntensity.praat' normalizes the peak intensity 
	of all of the files in the 'wav' folder
	- This should be applied to every wav folder
4. '3_createTextGrids.praat'
	- The 'createTextGrids.praat' file reads in every .wav file from the 
	'wav' folder and creates a corresponding textgrid.
	- The textgrid labels the onset of modal voicing and the stop burst
	- Burst measurement labels are also created for deriving spectral moments
5. '4_extractVals.praat'
	- The '4_extractVals.praat' file will read in all .wav files and their corresponding textgrids 
	in order to extraxt labeled information from (4).
	- This will create a .csv for each each participant for each session
	- All the .csv files will then be read into R and ajoined
6. After generating participant/session data file, it is necessary to append the following:
   "prefix,f1,f2,vot,ri,cog,sd,sk,kt,labID"
